# Learning a11y practices through building _Impact X_

# WTF is _Impact X_?

ThoughtWorks needed an internal design system to:

- improve speed to value for TechOps projects
- make things easier for Regional IT
- stop people reinventing the wheel (or buttons) with every new project
- establish a set of brand guidelines that were in code and easy to implement.

So the Australian beach collaborated with TechOps to produce one. And [we called it _Impact X_](https://tw-impact-x.thoughtworks-labs.net).

# Accessibility as a core principle

Accessibility ("a11y" for short) means that content and tools can be used by all people who need them, regardless of the technologies they use for interaction.

## Not all people are like you

Different people use different technologies. People with disabilities might use a combination of technologies to interface with what you build.

Depending on the source, 17-25% of humans require augmented assistance. That number is even higher for penguins.

## It changed the developer experience

Hannah to talk about thinking differently

## It encourages web standards

And so it builds in sustainability
