# Accessibility: It's everyone's job all the time

## Accessibility as a core principle

- Why we built in accessibility from the start
- Why we thought it was important
- A11y as a sensible default
- How it changes the developer experience
  - forces us to think about the purpose of everything we're putting on the screen
    - eg what is a link and what is a button?
- at least 20% of all humans require some augmented assistance when using technology <!-- ! check this -->
- improved the user experience for 100% of users

<!--
? I have a question to ask later
todo: ask hannah about the project

## Learning about the accessibility guidelines

What did Hannah know before starting on _Impact X_?

- Not much really. I knew about `alt`attributes and I knew that `arialabel` was a thing, but I didn't know why
- Had a basic understanding of why it meant that semantic html was important. Could have just had `div`s, but it would have a big impact.
- After working on _Impact X_ and working with Josh and Esther, who have more experience, I learnt a lot more about it and I think it made me a better developer.
  - A good reason as to why structuring html in a certain way is important
  - More aware of the user experience
  - Now I have Axe (from Decque) in my browser all the time
  - Quick tests as to whether something actually works.

What did Josh know?

- Quite a bit but learnt quite a bit more
  - started navigating using keyboard and Voiceover on Mac OS X
  - learnt about automated testing tools and what they don't tell you about your code's accessibility
    - eg the usefulness of `alt` attributes
  - became very aware of all the technology we build at ThoughtWorks that doesn't pass our own standards, and also how that's true for almost every other company that isn't an accessibility consultancy
- there's always more to learn and more ways to improve

## What can you do to get better at accessibility?

- use the tools
- have accessibility testing in the pipeline
- mouse/trackpad-free sessions
- use built-in screenreaders
- browser extensions for low vision or vision impairment
- do not use heading levels as font-sizing
- make sure everyone in your team knows that this is important
- make sure everyone in your team knows it's okay to ask questions because none of us knows everything and we can all learn
- test with real people who have with real different abilities
- MDN docs and other resources
- LinkedIn Learning session with Derek Fetherstone
